# Permissionless Ecosystem Funding Project

Welcome to the Permissionless Ecosystem Funding Project! This README provides an overview of the project, its features, and future plans. Our current platform is a POC to show how AoETH rewards can be used in the AO ecosystem.

## Introduction

Our project aims to create a permissionless ecosystem where users can discover new projects and help them grow their communities. By leveraging AO rewards and the ability to stake AoETH, users can actively participate in the development and success of these projects.

## Key Features

### Easy AO Rewards

Users can effortlessly earn AO rewards by participating in the ecosystem. Our platform is designed to make it simple for users to discover projects, engage with them, and receive rewards. This seamless process encourages active participation and support for innovative projects.

### Staking AoETH

Users have the ability to stake AoETH with various projects. By staking, users receive project tokens in return. This process not only supports the projects but also allows users to become stakeholders and benefit from the project's growth.

## Platform Overview

1. **Project Discovery**: Our platform provides a comprehensive list of projects for users to explore. Each project includes detailed information, goals, and progress updates.
2. **Community Growth**: Projects can leverage the platform to grow their communities, attract supporters, and gain valuable feedback.

3. **Staking and Rewards**: Users can stake AoETH with their favorite projects and earn project tokens. The staking process is straightforward and designed to maximize user engagement and rewards.

## Future Plans

Our future plans include expanding the platform's capabilities to offer more financial tools for users and projects:

- **Seamless Onboarding**: Projects will be able to easily post their projects and customize the rewards they want to give. We will have a guide on how to add a handler to get notified when you receive AoETH
- **Investing in Project Tokens**: Users will soon be able to invest in project tokens directly, providing additional support and funding to the projects they believe in.
- **Vesting of Project Tokens**: We plan to introduce a vesting feature, allowing users to lock their project tokens for a specified period. This ensures long-term commitment and stability for both users and projects.

## Conclusion

The Permissionless Ecosystem Funding Project is designed to empower users and projects alike. By making it easy to earn AO rewards and stake AoETH, we aim to create a vibrant and supportive ecosystem for innovation and growth.

We invite you to join us on this journey and contribute to the success of the projects you are passionate about. For more information and to get started, please visit our [platform](https://arweavehh.vercel.app).
